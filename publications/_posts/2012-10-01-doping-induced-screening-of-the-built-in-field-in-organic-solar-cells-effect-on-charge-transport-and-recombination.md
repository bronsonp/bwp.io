## Non-technical summary

A perfect semiconductor would not contain any charge carriers unless
energy was applied. For example, a solar cell would have no freely
moving electrons (negative charges) or holes (positive charges) until
sunlight creates them. Conversely, a semiconductor is "doped" if there
exist charge carriers despite the absence of any excitation. These
equilibrium carriers are created by impurities or defects called
dopants. Dopants are sometimes introduced deliberately to create
certain electrical properties, but other times dopants are unwanted
and can have a negative influence on the device.

Doping is unwanted in organic solar cells because it can interfere
with the photogenerated charge carriers. For example, charges created
by dopants will disturb the electric field inside the device,
hindering the extraction of the carriers created by the
sunlight. Doping is undesirable, but it is sometimes unavoidable due
to impurities in the materials used and/or the introduction of
reactive species such as oxygen. The more pure a material must be, the
more expensive it is to make, so it's important to characterise how
pure is "pure enough."

To answer the question of whether a material is sufficiently pure, we
need to examine the impact of doping on the performance of actual
devices. We need to compare devices with different levels of doping,
and see how the performance varies. Unfortunately, this is exceedingly
difficult to do in a reliable way. Different devices may not be
directly comparable to each other, because the raw materials and the
processing conditions may not always be identical. This is especially
true for devices made by hand in the lab. Consequently, one could
never be sure that the only thing that changed between any two devices
was the level of doping. (You could work around this limitation with
statistics if you made many devices, but this is time consuming and
expensive.)

What we really need to do this doping-vs-performance experiment
reliably is a way to adjust the level of doping in a single device. If
we could do that, then all the reproducibility problems would
disappear. This paper demonstrates how this can be achieved.

In any solar cell (or diode), there is a natural threshold scale for
charge concentration at which the physics changes. This threshold is
the capacitance of the diode structure (*C*) multiplied by the
effective voltage (*U*). The result of this multiplication, *CU*, has
units of charge. If the amount of charge present in the device is less
than *CU*, the electric field is largely undisturbed; conversely, if
the amount of charge exceeds *CU* then the electric field becomes
"screened" by the high amount of charge that is present. Importantly,
*CU* is under our control because we can adjust the voltage *U*.

Suppose that the amount of charge created by doping is *Q*. If *Q* is
less than *CU* then the amount of doping is small, and will not
interfere. On the other hand, if *Q* is larger than *CU*, then the
device is highly doped, and this might cause problems. In this paper,
we show that we can dynamically adjust the voltage *U* to switch
between low and high levels of doping.

Having developed a methodology to "switch on" the dopants, we are now
in a position to characterise their impact on a solar cell. To do this
we measure two key performance metrics at different levels of
doping. These are the charge carrier mobility (how quickly charges
move through the device), and the bimolecular recombination
coefficient (how quickly charges annihilate in the presence of the
opposite type). The conclusion: for this particular blend of
materials, the mobility and recombination coefficient do not change as
the device is moved from a low to a high level of
doping. Consequently, for this material, the level of doping that is
already present is not a problem, and there would be negligible
benefit to be gained from using more pure materials.
