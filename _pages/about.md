I am doing a PhD in physics at James Cook University in Townsville, Australia. My research is on organic semiconductors and charge transport. A substantial part of my work involves device simulation, for which I have written custom code in Matlab. I will use this blog to write about the science and programming that I do.

A list of my publications is available on my [Google Scholar page](http://scholar.google.com.au/citations?user=njhB7pgAAAAJ&hl=en).

To contact me, send an email to bronson.philippa@gmail.com.
